Just a post to test a few things

Can the site display a code snippet?

{% highlight python %}
import numpy

input = [2, 4, 8, 10]
x_squared = [x ** 2 for x in input]
{% endhighlight %}

Cool, that worked, but how about an equation?

$$ \mathcal{L}_j \left(x\right) = 42 $$

Ok, but surely you can't display viz. Could it be as simple as pasting the url with the query string ":showVizHome=no&:embed=true" into the markdown?
